            I am a programmer who enjoys solving difficult technological and interpersonal problems. I see code as a tool to create a better future in tech that is accessible to all. I have previous experience in Javascript and Python, and am currently learning full stack web development. Prior to tech, I worked in the service industry where I developed a talent for learning quickly, working hard, and understanding the needs of others. I see effective functionality as beauty, finding the optimal shape to solve a problem and create something is why I’m a software engineer.I am a programmer who enjoys solving difficult technological and interpersonal problems.

<div id="about">
    <p>This website was coded using python and bootstrap, and is hosted from the github project through heroku. As it currently is, everything is hard-coded, as I saw little use to writing a full database considering how few projects I currently have to show here. As my portfolio expands, I plan on adding a SQL database and the ability to manage both the order that the projects appear in, as well as adding new projects to the list easily.</p>
