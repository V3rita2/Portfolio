        I am a programmer who enjoys solving difficult technological and interpersonal problems. I see code as a tool to create a better future in tech that is accessible to all. I have previous experience in Javascript and Python, and am currently learning full stack web development. Prior to tech, I worked in the service industry where I developed a talent for learning quickly, working hard, and understanding the needs of others. I see effective functionality as beauty, finding the optimal shape to solve a problem and create something is why I’m a software engineer.I am a programmer who enjoys solving difficult technological and interpersonal problems.
